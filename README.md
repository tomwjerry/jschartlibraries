Here is a collection of diagram, chart, flowchart, whiteboard and similiar editors. Some of these appear to be difficult to search on internet search engines. Ideally, they should be able to, but I am at the moment unsure of it they can, run on a webbrowser client usin javascript togheter with SVG, Canvas, or similiar techonogy.

**Dgrm.net** \
https://github.com/AlexeyBoiko/DgrmJS \
A SVG based editor that at the core is rather limited. You can add shapes, move them, change color, add text and connect shapes with pathes. Everything else such as Undo / Redo, resize, group select, collobration is pro only. It is not documented at the moment.

**tldraw** \
https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw \
A Canvas based whiteboard editor that is build with React? It is possible to create plain looking flowcharts, that looks like drawn on whiteboard and has full functionality to edit. It appears to be customizable and extendable.

**excalidraw** \
https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw \
The most sophisticated editor found that appears to has the most features. The emphasis is clear to mimic handdrawn, paper like style graphics. Through, it is possible with a few adjustments to make it look more professional. While extendable, it appears to be rather complex.
