Here is a collection of diagram, chart, flowchart, whiteboard and similiar editors. Some of these appear to be difficult to search on internet search engines. Ideally, they should be able to, but I am at the moment unsure of it they can, run on a webbrowser client usin javascript togheter with SVG, Canvas, or similiar techonogy.

Dgrm.net https://github.com/AlexeyBoiko/DgrmJS A SVG based editor that at the core is rather limited. You can add shapes, move them, change color, add text and connect shapes with pathes. Everything else such as Undo / Redo, resize, group select, collobration is pro only.
